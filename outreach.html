            <h3>Université des Enfants (Children's University) </h3>
            <p>
            As a member of the Children's University, I have designed and animated a workshop for children of age 6-12 with my colleague Jean Kimus. This workshop is centered around the notion of electricity. Children build a small electric system, composed of a battery, electric wires, and a small LED. They then use this circuit to build an "electric quizz", which light the LED up when you connect a question with the appropriated answer. Kids can then bring this circuit home and play with friends and family, to share their newly acquired knowledge in electricity. In collaboration with ULB-engagée (link). </p>

                target="_blank" style="color: darkgray; text-decoration: none;"><em>Space in class</em></a> </h3>
            <p> In 2024, I participated in the Belgian edition of 'Ma thèse en 180 secondes' (my thesis in 180 seconds). With the help of one single slide, I pitched my PhD research project in 3 minutes to a general audience. I was qualified for the Belgian finals, and won the public prize there. Thanks to my supporters in the room <3.

            <h3>Outreach presentations </h3>

            <p> With colleagues Sébastien Clesse, Jean Kimus and Léa Planquart, we prepared an interactive conference aimed a children, where we told them stories about our mysterious Universe, and the even more mysterious dark matter that it contains. We had the opportunity to act at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Charleroi in front of more than 100 children and parents (number to check)! </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upcoming: public lectures of astronomy - I will be presenting a bloc of 4 lectures for the broad audience; the topic will be the current status of research on dark matter</li>
