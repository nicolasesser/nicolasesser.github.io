As a member of the Children's University, I have designed and animated a workshop for children of age 6-12 with my colleague Jean Kimus. This workshop is centered around the notion of electricity. Children build a small electric system, composed of a battery, electric wires, and a small LED. They then use this circuit to build an "electric quizz", which light the LED up when you connect a question with the appropriated answer. Kids can then bring this circuit home and play with friends and family, to share their newly acquired knowledge in electricity.

<p> With colleagues Sébastien Clesse, Jean Kimus and Léa Planquart, we prepared an interactive conference aimed a children, where we told them stories about our mysterious Universe, and the even more mysterious dark matter that it contains. We also had the opportunity to act at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Charleroi in front of close to a hundrer children and parents! </p>

<h1> Ma thèse en 180 secondes (My thesis in 180 seconds) </h1>

<p> In 2024, I participated in the Belgian edition of 'Ma thèse en 180 secondes' (my thesis in 180 seconds). With the help of one single slide, I pitched my PhD research project in 3 minutes to a general audience. I was qualified for the Belgian finals, and won the public prize there. Thanks to my supporters in the room <3. You can find a recording of my performance on YouTube:
