    <h3> Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei in Galaxy Clusters: a comparative analysis between Observations and Cosmological Simulations </h3>
    <p><strong>University of Montreal (UdeM) / Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) | 2023 - now |</strong></p>
    <p> With Prof. Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo (UdeM) and Dr. Annalisa Pillepich (MPIA).</p>
    <p> 
        My thesis project aims to explore in depth the effect of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on 
        galaxy clusters. This research contributs to our understanding 
        of the evolutionary mechanisms of galaxy clusters, a fundamental field of astrophysics and cosmology. 
        <p>
        </p>
        Located in the central galaxy of a cluster, an AGN is an active supermassive black hole 
        that emits bright jets and winds, and influences the overall dynamics and structure of the surrounding galaxy
         cluster through AGN feedback. One of the most remarkable manifestations of which is the creation of gigantic X-ray emitting cavities 
        in the intracluster medium. The study of active galactic nuclei is an active research topic,
         involving both observations and cosmological simulations, such as IllustrisTNG, for improving our understanding of these phenomena.
        <p>
        </p>
        My thesis project aims to study the complex mechanisms governing the evolution of galaxy clusters and
         to determine whether the AGN feedback models implemented in the IllustrisTNG simulations
        are in agreement with actual observations of galaxy clusters.

    <h3>Subsolar Black Hole Hunt in the LIGO-Virgo 3rd Observation Run</h3>
    <p><strong>Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) | March - June 2023 | Bruxelles, Belgium </strong></p>
    <p>With Prof. Sébastien Clesse (LIGO-Virgo collaboration), at the Theoretical Physics department of ULB.</p>
    <p>Analysis and parameter estimation of a subsolar-mass black hole candidate in LIGO-Virgo 3rd observing run.</p>
    <p> The search for subsolar mass black holes is an exciting topic for the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, 
    as the detection of such objects would provide evidence for the existence of primordial 
    black holes. In the following paper, we perform a complete study of a subsolar black hole candidate
     identified in the second part of the third observing run of the gravitational wave detector of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.

    <p> Development of machine learning routines to analyse X-ray emissions from galaxy clusters. 
        The spectrum of Abell 1795 cluster, used as a stable calibration source during the lifetime of CHANDRA, 
        shows a decline in count rates over time as the instrument ages. 
        This effect affects calibration, the aim is to use a machine learning method called Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) 
        to characterise and recalibrate the spectrometer properly.</p>

        taking place in the scope of the Comet Interceptor spacecraft mission (European Space Agency).</p>
    <p> We set up simulations of the spacecraft charging and plasma interaction during the comet's flyby.
        The goal was to quantify how it affects the performances of one of the instruments using the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software and 
        publish a Technical Note on the results obtained for the ESA DFP-consortium in charge of Comet Interceptor scientific payload.</p>
