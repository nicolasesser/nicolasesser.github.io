Hi, I am Nicolas, a PhD student in theoretical astrophysics at the University of Brussels in Belgium.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on dark matter, one of the main components of our Universe (accounting for ~85% of its mass!), yet whose nature remains mysterious. More specifically, I study how dark matter may interact with stars and influence their dynamics and evolution, in the hope of better understanding this elusive substance someday. For more details, please check out the <strong> <a href="research"style="color: darkgreen ; text-decoration: none;">RESEARCH</a> </strong> and <strong> <a href="CV" style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;">CV</a></strong> tabs.
</p>

<p>
I am also involved in science communication, for example, through public talks and children's workshops. Go check the <strong><a href="outreach" style="color: darkmagenta; text-decoration: none;">OUTREACH </a> </strong> tab!

<p>
Don't hesitate to reach out, my <strong> <a href="contact" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: none;">CONTACT</a></strong> informations are here.

You can also find my detailed curriculum vitae in the dedicated <strong><a href="CV" style="color: darkmagenta; text-decoration: none;">CV </a> </strong> tab.
