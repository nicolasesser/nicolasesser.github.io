Hi, I am Marine, a PhD in astrophysics at the University of Montreal and the Max-Planck for Astronomy.<br> 
My research focuses on the study of high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as active galactic nuclei in galaxy clusters. 
These are the most powerful light sources in the Universe, powered by a central active supermassive black hole 
emitting bright jets, winds and radiations. I am investigating the influence of these active black holes on the dynamics and structure 
of the surrounding cluster gas. I am conducting a comparative analysis of the observational 
signature of supermassive black hole feedback with the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations.
</p>
<p>
My academic career has taken me to various universities in Switzerland, 
Belgium, France and Canada, where I had the opportunity to work on several research 
topics in astrophysics but also in aerospace engineering and planetary sciences. 
I am also a passionate sky-watcher and have had several experiences as an astronomer along the way!<br>
For more information on my present and past research projects, please check out the <strong> <a href="research"style="color: darkgreen ; text-decoration: none;">RESEARCH</a> </strong> and <strong> <a href="publications" style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;">PUBLICATIONS</a></strong> tabs.
</p>

<p>
Beyond research, I'm involved in communicating science to the general public and promoting the inclusion of women in science. For years, I have been engaged in youth outreach through Space@yourservice in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, promoting space science for all, and with Club Mars in France, a Red Planet-focused science popularization association. 
I am also co-organiser of Astronomy on Tap in Montreal, with regular monthly events in bars around the city. Go check the <strong><a href="outreach" style="color: darkmagenta; text-decoration: none;">OUTREACH </a> </strong> tab.
