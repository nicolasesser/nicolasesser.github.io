Hi, I am Nicolas, a PhD student in theoretical astrophysics at the University of Brussels in Belgium.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on dark matter, one of the main components of our Universe (accounting for ~85% of its mass!), yet whose nature remains mysterious. More specifically, I study how dark matter may interact with stars and influence their dynamics and evolution, in the hope of better understanding this elusive substance someday. For more details, please check out the <strong> <a href="research"style="color: darkblue ; text-decoration: none;">RESEARCH</a> </strong> tab. You can also find my detailed scientific publications and curriculum vitae in the dedicated <strong><a href="CV" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: none;">CV & PUBLICATIONS </a> </strong> tab.
</p>

<p>
I am also involved in science communication, for example, through public talks and children's workshops. Go check the <strong><a href="outreach" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: none;">OUTREACH </a> </strong> tab!
</p>

<p>
Besides science, I enjoy hiking, spending time with friends and family, enjoying a good (Belgian, of course) beer, and learning about dinosaurs. Before my life as a scientist, I was a very shy piano player, an avid videogamer, and a member of the Belgian Scouts for 17 years. Whenever I have the chance, I like to dive back into these hobbies.
